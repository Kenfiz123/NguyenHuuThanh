During my internship at AWS, I had the opportunity to work in a highly professional environment that demanded strong discipline, self-learning ability, and advanced problem-solving skills. This experience allowed me not only to reinforce the knowledge I had learned at university but also to expand my thinking by participating directly in real-world operational processes.

In the project [briefly describe the main project or task], I was responsible for [list several key tasks such as building modules, optimizing systems, implementing CI/CD pipelines, processing data, writing technical documentation, etc.]. Throughout this process, I significantly enhanced my professional capabilities, including:

* Technical skills: working with AWS services, developing and optimizing applications, processing data, designing basic cloud architecture, and implementing automated pipelines.

* Analytical & problem-solving skills: evaluating requirements, analyzing processing flows, and proposing solutions to improve performance and system stability.

* Teamwork & communication skills: collaborating with my mentor and team members through sprint meetings, progress reporting, code reviews, and technical discussions.

* Documentation & reporting skills: maintaining clear notes, preparing technical documentation, and summarizing work outputs in a professional manner.

Beyond technical experience, the AWS environment helped me develop a proactive work mindset, the ability to self-research new technologies, and a strong sense of responsibility in every assigned task. The knowledge and experience gained during this internship have greatly increased my confidence as I move forward into future real-world projects. 

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Areas for Improvement

* Enhancing discipline and professional conduct: I recognize the need to further improve my adherence to organizational rules, work standards, and internal culture in any company or environment I participate in.

* Improving problem-solving mindset: Although I have been exposed to various real-world scenarios, I still need to strengthen my ability to analyze root causes, evaluate different solution approaches, and propose optimal decisions more quickly and effectively.

* Developing communication skills: I aim to improve my ability to articulate ideas clearly in daily interactions and work-related discussions, as well as handle situations more professionally. This will help me better collaborate with colleagues and integrate smoothly into a professional working environment.
