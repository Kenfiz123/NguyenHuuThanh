## 📝 General Evaluation

### **1. Working Environment**
The working environment is very friendly and open. Members in the FCJ team are always willing to support me whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is clean, organized, and comfortable, which helps me stay more focused.  


### **2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**
My mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained clearly when I didn’t understand something, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The admin team supported all procedures, documentation, and created favorable conditions for me to work comfortably. I truly appreciate that my mentor allowed me to try and handle problems by myself instead of giving the answer immediately.

### **3. Alignment Between Assigned Tasks and My Major**
The tasks I was assigned matched the knowledge I learned at school and also expanded into new areas I had never approached before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

### **4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**
Throughout the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared a lot of real-world experience that helped me better orient my future career path.

### **5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there is an urgent project, everyone puts in the effort together, without distinguishing roles or positions. This made me feel like I was truly part of the team, even though I was just an intern.

### **6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**
The company provides internship allowance and flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, being able to join internal training sessions is a significant advantage.
